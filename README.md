# Goal of this repository

This repo is supposed to track my progress through computer science
competitions(? I guess I can call them competitions)

# LaTeX

I shall take notes with LaTeXand then convert them to Markdown. To
convert it into my README.md, I’ll just use the following:

``` bash
pandoc notes/main.tex -o README.md --from=latex --to=gfm
```
